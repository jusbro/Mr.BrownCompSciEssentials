#In this code, you will practice using the input() function.
#The input() function is a great way to get user input to use in your program.

#Example:
#name = input("What is your name? ")
#This example asks the user for their name and stores it in the variable "name".
#The program pauses until the user presses the enter key.

#Try it yourself!
#Ask the user for their favorite color and store it in a variable called "color".
#Then, print the variable to the screen.
#Make sure to use the input() function and the print() function.
