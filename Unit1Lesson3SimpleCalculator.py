#In this lesson you are building a simple calculator.

#The program should ask the user for two numbers.
#It should store both numbers as separate variables:
#The first number should be stored in a variable called "firstNumber".
#The second number should be stored in a variable called "secondNumber".

#ADD: It should then add the two numbers together and store the result in a variable called "sum".
#SUBTRACT: It should then subtract the second number from the first number and store the result in a variable called "difference".
#MULTIPLY: It should then multiply the two numbers together and store the result in a variable called "product".
#DIVIDE: It should then divide the first number by the second number and store the result in a variable called "quotient".

#Your calculator should then print all of these variables to the screen.
#Each variable should be printed on a separate line with a label.
#The output should look something like this:

#Sum: 7
#Difference: 1
#Product: 12
#Quotient: 3.0

#Your calculator will not ask the user what math operation they want to perform, instead it does +,-,*,/ every time

#DO YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:
