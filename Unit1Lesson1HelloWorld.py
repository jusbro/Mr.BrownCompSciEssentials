#This is your first program in Python!
#It is traditional to start with a "Hello World!" program.

#To print a message to the screen, use the print() function.
#The print() function takes a string as an argument.
#A string is a sequence of characters.
#Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

#Example:
#print("Hello World!")

#Do you notice the "#" symbol at the beginning of some lines?
#This is called a comment.
#Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter.
#They are used to explain what the code is doing.
#Comments are very important for making code readable.
#You should comment your code as much as possible.

#Try it yourself!
#Have the computer print "Hello World!" to the screen.
#Make sure to use the print() function.
#Make sure to use quotes around the string.


#DO IT ON THE NEXT LINE:


#Run your code using the play button on the top right of the screen
#You should see "Hello World!" printed to the screen.
#If you don't see it, ask for help.

#Use the rest of this space to complete the assignment as outlined in the packet.
#Make sure to comment your code as much as possible.
